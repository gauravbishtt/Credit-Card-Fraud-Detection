# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection

ABSTRACT â€“ The project is mainly focussed on credit card fraud detection in real world.  With the proposed scheme, using random forest algorithm the accuracy of detecting the fraud can be improved can be improved. Classification process of random forest algorithm to analyse data set and user current dataset. Finally optimize the accuracy of the result data. The performance of the techniques is evaluated based on accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity, and precision.
We are applying random forest algorithm for classification of the credit card dataset. Random Forest is an algorithm for classification and regression. 
Random forest ranks the importance of variables in a regression or classification problem in a natural way can be done
by Random Forest.
The 'amount' feature is the transaction amount. Feature 'class' is the target class for the binary classification and it takes value 1 for positive case (fraud) and 0 for negative case(not fraud).

SOFTWARE REQUIREMENTS - Python, Anaconda, OS - Windows 7, 8 and 10 (32 and 64 bit).

ALGORITHM USED - Random Forest
Random forest is a type of supervised machine learning algorithm based on ensemble learning. Ensemble learning is a type of learning where you join different types of algorithms or same algorithm multiple times to form a more powerful prediction model. The random forest algorithm combines multiple algorithm of the same type i.e. multiple decision trees, resulting in a forest of trees, hence the name "Random Forest". The random forest algorithm can be used for both regression and classification tasks.

ADVANTAGES OF USING RANDOM FOREST - 
1. The random forest algorithm is not biased.
2. This algorithm is very stable. Even if a new data point is introduced in the dataset the overall algorithm is not affected much.
3. The random forest algorithm works well when you have both categorical and numerical features.
4. The random forest algorithm also works well when data has missing values or it has not been scaled well.

CONCLUSION - The Random forest algorithm will perform better with a larger number of training data, but speed during testing and application will suffer. Application of more pre-processing techniques would also help. Others algorithm still suffers from the imbalanced dataset problem and requires more preprocessing to give better results at the results shown by other algorithms is great but it could have been better if more preprocessing have been done on the data.
